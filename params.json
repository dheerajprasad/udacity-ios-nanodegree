Then share on your favorite social channels!\r\n\r\n### Project 2.2\r\n## P2.2: MemeMe 2.0: The Final Product\r\n\r\n   You will create an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. Memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.\r\n\r\n### Project 3\r\n## P3: On the Map\r\n\r\n  Add your current location to a map of locations for other Nanodegree students. Also, post a link to your own blog post, project, or portfolio for others to see.\r\n\r\n### Project 4\r\n## P4: Virtual Tourist\r\n\r\n  Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch! This app allows you to drop pins on a map and pull up Flickr images associated with that location. You will store the locations and images using Core Data.\r\n\r\n### Projetct 5 (Capstone)\r\n## P5: You Decide!\r\n\r\n![](https://image-private.slidesharecdn.com/07f5f4c8-9e84-4ee0-9c61-d2024b994789-160924153119/95/slide-1-638.jpg)",
